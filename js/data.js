/**
 * PDF Data Array
 *
 * This array contains all PDF information for the study materials library.
 * Each PDF object should have the following properties:
 *
 * - id: Unique identifier (number)
 * - title: Display name of the PDF (string)
 * - category: Subject category (string) - must match category names exactly
 * - filename: PDF filename with extension (string)
 * - path: Relative path to the PDF file (string)
 * - description: Brief description of the content (string, optional)
 *
 * To add a new PDF:
 * 1. Upload the PDF file to the appropriate pdfs/[category]/ folder
 * 2. Add a new object to the pdfData array below with all required properties
 * 3. Make sure the category name matches existing categories or create a new one
 * 4. Ensure the path correctly points to the PDF file location
